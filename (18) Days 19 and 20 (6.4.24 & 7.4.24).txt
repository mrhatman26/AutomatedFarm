Notes for Days 19 and 20:
I didn't plan on doing more for this project. But I thought that since it's based around global warming,
should add some form of climate "simulation".
Thus far, I have added a new class called "ClimateManager". This "simulates" the months, the seasons
the external temperature and the internal temperature. The temperatures have no affect right now, but my
plan is to make the costs of the planters more expensive. I.E: The building costs more to heat. Or I might add
a heat cost on its own.
The temperatures are stored in two arrays, "EXTERNAL_TEMPERATURE_TARGETS" and "INTERNAL_TEMPERATURE_TARGETS",
which have 4 numbers that represent the target temperature for each season. (The actual target is a random within range of these numbers)
So I also plan to add two more arrays that are "extreme" versions of the normal ones to "simulate" the climate getting worse.

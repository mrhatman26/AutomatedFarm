Day 5 Notes:
Unable to work the past WEEK (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻ due to having a really bad cold. I've got a lot to cath up on... Damnit...
Anyway, I started at 12:30, but was unable to do anything due to Trello not accepting my email for some reason. For
HALF AN HOUR?!
Then I had something else to do so I've only really started at 13:57...
Anyway:
-14:22: A bunch of small changes.
	>Fixed a bunch of for loops in multiple classes by swapping the greater than symbol with a less than symbol.
	>Created a new class called "PathTranslator.java"
	>Made it so PlanterPaths have rectangles and are drawn by the main class.

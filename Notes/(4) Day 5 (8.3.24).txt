Day 5 Notes:
Unable to work the past WEEK (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻ due to having a really bad cold. I've got a lot to cath up on... Damnit...
Anyway, I started at 12:30, but was unable to do anything due to Trello not accepting my email for some reason. For
HALF AN HOUR?!
Then I had something else to do so I've only really started at 13:57...
Anyway:
-14:22: A bunch of small changes.
	>Fixed a bunch of for loops in multiple classes by swapping the greater than symbol with a less than symbol.
	>Created a new class called "PathTranslator.java"
	>Made it so PlanterPaths have rectangles and are drawn by the main class.
-14:38: Wrote the code for the method "readPaths" in the PathTranslator class.
	>I decided to replace the String[] with a regular String as I can do the following:
		>>"path+path+path+path+etc"
	>Using a String[] would require two while loops. One while loop is already really bad in my opinion.
	>Now to have the code read the paths and create them... :|
-15:22: Got the code to read the path descriptions and create them.
	>This does not include rows and columns as of yet, just the outline.
	>It doesn't work correctly yet. I think I need to flip my Y coordinates.
	>Why does libGDX have to flip the Y unlike every other game library? -_-
-15:33: Okay, the problem is not the Y being swapped...
	>The problem is that I was not taking the path's sprite size into accout... -_-
-16:40: After far too long, I finally got the code to create the described shape.
	>Now to have it add the rows and columns as well...
	>I also need to seperate the paths a bit.
	>But for now, I'm taking a break. I WILL BE BACK. I'm not messing around anymore.

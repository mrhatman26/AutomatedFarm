Day 15 Notes:
Started at 10:00am.
-11:00: Tried using enums for my switch cases.
	>They don't work and seem useless.
	>What an utter waste of time.
-11:30: Planters now move to the next path
	when they can't create Plants.
	>Buggy and stops planters from
	creating new plants.
	>off to work though -_-

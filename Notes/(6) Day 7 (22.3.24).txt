Day 7 Notes:
Had to take a week to do some other work. Now back to this.
Started at 11AM.
-12:00: Spent the hour modifying classes to create planters on the path. Still needs work though...
-13:30: Back to it.
-14:00: Finished trello card "Have Planters be created on the paths".
	>A lot has been added to classess associated with the planters and planterPaths.
-15:00: Break time!
	>Started the code to allow planters to move.
	>Changed some other code to throw exceptions when they should. (added the throw command essentially)
	>Started to make the actual paths that will be used rather than the ones I've been using.
	>The old paths are in oldPaths.txt
-16:00: Back to it!
-16:30: Finished writing all four paths. Technically, my code allows for more, but I'll keep it to 4.
	>I also shrunk the plant and planter sprites by half. The plants are now the same size
	as planterPaths and the planters are the same size plants used to be.
	(Plants are now 16x16 and planters are 32x32)

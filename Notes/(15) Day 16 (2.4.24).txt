Day 16 Notes:
Started at 9:00am.
-9:30: I was trying to figure out why my planters are only creating 3 Plants.
	>I am really dumb.
	>Somehow... The planters are constantly updating Plant positions to their own?
	>WHY?! -_-
-10:00: I've been looking at this for a while now. Little progress.
	>moveToTarget seems to be overriding Plant positions?
	>Plant positions are private so Planters should not be able to change them.
	>There is also NO method to change them apart from the initiliser.
	>If Planters are moving to a target, the code to create Plants is ignored anyway?
	>Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-?
-11:00: STILL CAN'T FIND THE PROBLEM >:|
-11:30: STILL NOTHING.
	>I've had a thought though... Why not do away with myPlants?
	>It might help, it probably won't though.
	>Worthy a try I guess.
-12:00: The thing I tried didn't fix the bug. How surprising /s.
	>To quote my neighbour just now: "It's not going to work".

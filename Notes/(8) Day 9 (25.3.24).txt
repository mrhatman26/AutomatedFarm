Day 9 notes:
Started at 10am.
-10:30: Planters can now move on columns to their target, but not on rows.
	>At least, I think they can?
-11:30: Have to stop for now as I need to help drive someone and then I will be off to work.
-20:30: Back to it. Bit late, ey?
-21:00: Can't focus due to worrying about something. The thing I am worrying about will mean
I might not get much done tomorrow either. Gah! How will I finish this in time?! -_-

Day 2 Notes:
-11:00 Starting up again...
-11:05: Completed Trello task "Setup Main Class".
	>The main now has a sprite batch, texture (background) and a camera.
	>This is still in "In Progress" in Trello as I have not drawn the background sprite as of yet.
-11:17: Completed Trello task "Create Plant Object".
	>I've given the timers better names ending in "ing".
	>I changed the "Add creator" task to add a creator that takes parameters to set the class' timers.
	>This is also still in progress due to having no sprite.

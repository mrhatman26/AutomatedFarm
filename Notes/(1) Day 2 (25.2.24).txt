Day 2 Notes:
-11:00: Starting up again...
-11:05: Completed Trello task "Setup Main Class".
	>The main now has a sprite batch, texture (background) and a camera.
	>This is still in "In Progress" in Trello as I have not drawn the background sprite as of yet.
-11:17: Completed Trello task "Create Plant Object".
	>I've given the timers better names ending in "ing".
	>I changed the "Add creator" task to add a creator that takes parameters to set the class' timers.
	>This is also still in progress due to having no sprite.
-11:29: Completed Trello task "Create Planter Object".
	>Ditto for sprite.
-11:35: Completed Trello task "Create PlanterPath Object".
	>Ditto for sprites.
-11:45: Completed Trello task "Create ControlPanel Object".
	>Ditto for sprites.
	>Added a file called "Interfaces" with "disposable" inside as I realised all of the classes thus
	far have the dipsose method. It is useless in my opinion, but it is good practice.
-11:50: Another thing to do. Looks like I won't be back for a good few hours... -_-

Day 6 Notes:
Started at 13:50. Will most likely achieve nothing today. As usual... -_-
-14:06: Working on the planter paths still. 
	>I decided to remove the idea of rows and columns for simplicity and to make
	programming this quicker.
	>The last four numbers that describe a path are now a single number that describes
	the spaces between PlanterPaths.
-15:12: It took a long while, but I fixed(????) the pathing creation.
	>That was a quite a bit so I'm going to take a break.
	>This is something I actually dislike about programming:
		>>A lot of the time, you do so much code and yet
		to others, it looks like you've barely done anything.

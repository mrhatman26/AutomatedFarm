Day 6 Notes:
Started at 13:50. Will most likely achieve nothing today. As usual... -_-
-14:06: Working on the planter paths still. 
	>I decided to remove the idea of rows and columns for simplicity and to make
	programming this quicker.
	>The last four numbers that describe a path are now a single number that describes
	the spaces between PlanterPaths.
-15:12: It took a long while, but I fixed(????) the pathing creation.
	>That was a quite a bit so I'm going to take a break.
	>This is something I actually dislike about programming:
		>>A lot of the time, you do so much code and yet
		to others, it looks like you've barely done anything.
-16:00: Back to it...
-16:26: The amount of planterPaths for each row and column is now calculated.
	>Each planterPath now gets its row and column set.
-17:00: Fixed the rows and columns not being set properly.
	>Added a variable called debug. When set to true, debug stuff will be drawn.
	>The only debug stuff as of now is the row and column number of each planterPath.
	>Unfortunately need to leave this here due to a call :/

Day 11 Notes:
Started at 13:30.
-13:42: I've decided to rewrite the movement code.
	>The current way makes the planters take
	a longer route sometimes. It also has that bug
	from yesterday and I can't see a way to fix that
	in the code's current form.
-14:11: Fixed it. I didn't need to rewrite it.
	>Now to test it as much as I can and fix whatever goes wrong.
-14:19: Found a problem because of course I have.
	>Planter can move to its targets just fine when it STARTS
	on rows with columns (AKA, the top and bottom rows), but
	if it starts on columns with rows (AKA, the left and right columns)
	then there is an index out of bounds error.
-14:32: Not sure why the index error happened.
	>Planters freeze if they are given a target
	on a column row if they themselves are on one.
	Need to fix this... 
-16:08: Damn this took a while...
	>I think(?) I finally got this pathing to work?
	>Took a long time to do, but it barely looks like much, as usual.
	>I am going to record some short videos of this working and turn them into gifs.
	>I will probably find another bug or more while doing this.

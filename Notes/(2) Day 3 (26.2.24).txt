Day 3 Notes:
-Started backup at 13:32 by starting on the sprites...
-14:00: Call with private tutor for 1 hour.
-15:19: Wrote "staticMethods" Java file.
	>This will contain static methods that have no class associated with them.
	>The first method is "spriteTest" which I wrote to create sprites without crashing the game when the specified image file does not exist.
	>Edited all classes including the main to use this method when creating sprites. (GDX calls them Textures by the way)
-15:40: Finally completed Trello task "Draw Sprites".
	>Me taking so long to draw these basic shapes should show to you how bad I am at Photoshop.
	>I am just going too slow in general. (Me dumb)
-15:45: Oops, I accidentally added files to the git in the wrong folder so now my git comment looks stupid. (It's missing the files that I mention in it...)
	>Going to take an undeserved break now. This'll never be done at this rate... -_- I'm a dumbass.
-16:30: Started drawing the background sprite.
-17:00: Dinner time. Background sprite looks meh.
-19:20: Back to it. I had a long conversation about steaks and good steak restaurants and now I'm hungry again. Mmmm, steak. :P
-19:44: Finally finished the background sprite. It'd have been done a lot quicker if PhotoShop had better grid options, but that's no excuse so whatever.
-19:57: All classes are now created fully with their sprites. End for today. Not that I did much.
	>"Create ControlPanel" is still not finished, but is under a new column on Trello which is for cards that cannot be completed due to missing something.
	>I changed the colour of both the PlanterPath sprites to be white as I made the background colour black for some reason.
	>I suck at everything.
	>I have moved the review progress card into To Do. I will be doing that to start with tomorrow.

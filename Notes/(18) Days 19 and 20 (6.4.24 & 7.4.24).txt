Notes for Days 19 and 20:
Started Day 20 at 10am.

I didn't plan on doing more for this project. But I thought that since it's based around global warming,
should add some form of climate "simulation".
Thus far, I have added a new class called "ClimateManager". This "simulates" the months, the seasons
the external temperature and the internal temperature. The temperatures have no affect right now, but my
plan is to make the costs of the planters more expensive. I.E: The building costs more to heat. Or I might add
a heat cost on its own.
The temperatures are stored in two arrays, "EXTERNAL_TEMPERATURE_TARGETS" and "INTERNAL_TEMPERATURE_TARGETS",
which have 4 numbers that represent the target temperature for each season. (The actual target is a random within range of these numbers)
So I also plan to add two more arrays that are "extreme" versions of the normal ones to "simulate" the climate getting worse.

-15:50: Added the extreme climate and the cost of it.
	>If it gets too hot or too cold, the cost of maintaining the temperature
	increases.
	>These costs are deducted when the month changes.
	>Unlike my plan, the planters aren't affected.
	>Now, to finish this project, I plan to add a system which triggers the climate to become extreme and,
	make planting plants actually cost money.
-16:27: Plants now cost money and I've now added overlays to represent the seasons.
	>Still need to do the extreme climate trigger thing...
-17:20: Extreme climate is now a random chance.
	>It starts with a low chance, but every time it fails to occur, the chance gets higher.
	>If it does occur, the chance is reset to be low again.
	>The middle of the screen now states if the climate is normal or not.
	>If it is not normal, it flashes like a miliatary warning system! :woah:

And that's everything, I will attempt to clean this up while doing my report, but eh, don't count on it.

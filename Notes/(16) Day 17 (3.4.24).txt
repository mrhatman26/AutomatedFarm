Day 17 Notes:
Started at 10:00am.
-11:10: Plants can now be harvested.
	>Surprisingly easy to implement.
	>I wonder what I did wrong then.
-11:20: Plants can now be cleared when "failed".
	>Basically the same code as the last bit.
	>I think I may have seen a problem with this code,
	but unless this problem occurs, I'll save what I think
	might be the solution. (Which means I'll probably forget about it)

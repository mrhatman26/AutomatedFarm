Day 14 Notes: (File 13, unlucky)
Started at 10am.
-10:35: Planters can now create plants to their left.
	>Plants don't do anything yet.
	>Need to implement an algorithm to avoid
	plants being created on planterPaths.
-11:07: Planters can now create plants in four directions.
	>They will only create plants if the space is empty.
	>Will need to change to check if other plants are in the way
	too.
-11:14: Another pathing bug -_-
	>It was the one that happened a while back that I could not fix.
	>Turns out I was telling the planter to go to a non existent path
	and THEN checking if the path was null and THEN moving to it again.
	>Haha, I knew I wasn't Master Computer Science material.

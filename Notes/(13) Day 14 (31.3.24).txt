Day 14 Notes: (File 13, unlucky)
Started at 10am.
-10:35: Planters can now create plants to their left.
	>Plants don't do anything yet.
	>Need to implement an algorithm to avoid
	plants being created on planterPaths.
-11:07: Planters can now create plants in four directions.
	>They will only create plants if the space is empty.
	>Will need to change to check if other plants are in the way
	too.
-11:14: Another pathing bug -_-
	>It was the one that happened a while back that I could not fix.
	>Turns out I was telling the planter to go to a non existent path
	and THEN checking if the path was null and THEN moving to it again.
	>Haha, I knew I wasn't Master Computer Science material.
-12:00: Started writing code to allow planters to move to other planterPaths to create Plants.
	>This is going to be complex!
	>It's nowhere near done.
-14:00: Back to it...
-15:27: I've been trying to get it to check for other plants but...
	>It's planting hundreds of plants with no stopping...
	>I think it's because I'm using a switch case when I should be
	using a for loop...
	>I will copy the current code and try to replace it with a for loop
	and if it goes wrong, I'll paste the old code back... -_-
-16:00: Spent so long trying to get this to work...
	>Then I realise that two of my methods ARE EXACTLY THE SAME.
	>And one of them isn't supposed to be in the PlanterPathCreator, it's
	supposed to be in the Planter class itself.
	>God damn, why am I so utterly incompetent? -_-
-16:06: Okay, so I put the method I was supposed to use in...
	>Now no plants are created...
	>Hmm...
-16:27: I fixed it!
	>But now I feel even more stupid because the problem was nothing more
	than a simple case of a equality sign being the wrong way in one of my for loops.
	>-_-
-16:30: With that annoying waste of time. I'm going to waste even more time!
	>That's right, it's time for a break...

Day 18 Notes:
Started at 10am.
-10:18: Money is now added after a timer has elapsed.
	>Money is also deducted too. But nothing generates costs.
	>Money is added to a variable called "moneyIn" by the PlantHandler
	when a Planter harvests a Plant. After the money timer reaches zero,
	this money is added to the overal total.
-11:02: Added two new classes.
	>They are called "FloatingText" and "FloatingTextHandler".
	>Basically, when money is added or removed, the value of that change floats out
	of the object that caused it and fades away.
	>E.G: If a Plant is harvested, its value will appear as green text a slowly
	floating up and fading away. Waste of time yes, but I thought it'd be cool.
-11:20: Planters now periodically add a random amount to moneyOut.
	>What is odd, is that, even when moneyOut is reset to 0 when the money timer runs out,
	the planters add to moneyOut so quickly you don't really see the 0.
-11:30: Going for a break. Yeah, I don't deserve it, but whatever.
-14:00: Back to it...
-14:24: To be honest... I think I'm done?
	>Yeah, the control panel wasn't added, but meh.
	>Going to record a video or two and take some screenshots.
	>The report of this is going to be annoying. (Which is an understatement)

Day 11 Notes:
Maybe I might get something done today? Haha, what a joke of a statement.
Started at 10am
11:05: Spent a long time on nothing... I mea-
	>I added the teleport functionality to moveToTarget.
	>I did this to test if my movement code worked.
	>Took me so long to implement because I had to debug.
	>The root cause of it not working was because I set the targetPos to 8, 0.
	>That is, the 8th column on row 0. Row 0 doesn't exist -_-
	>If I faced palmed myself over this, I think I'd knock myself out
	from my anger propelling my hand so fast. -_-
11:30: Having lunch and leaving for work.
	>Got planters to move along columns and up rows!
	>Now I need to make it so that planters can come back along rows
	once they've reached their target row.
	>Something worked for once. ^_^
	>Won't keep working, that's for sure.
19:52: Back to it!
20:30: Planters can now move back along rows.
	>However, if the target is on a row with no columns
	AND the planter is closer to the opposite side of the target,
	the planter will go up the opposite side's rows and then stop
	at the target row expecting to be able to go along the columns
	when it can't and so it freezes. Need to fix this and then I can
	move on to other stuff I think.

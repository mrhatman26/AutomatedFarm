Day 11 Notes:
Maybe I might get something done today? Haha, what a joke of a statement.
Started at 10am
11:05: Spent a long time on nothing... I mea-
	>I added the teleport functionality to moveToTarget.
	>I did this to test if my movement code worked.
	>Took me so long to implement because I had to debug.
	>The root cause of it not working was because I set the targetPos to 8, 0.
	>That is, the 8th column on row 0. Row 0 doesn't exist -_-
	>If I faced palmed myself over this, I think I'd knock myself out
	from my anger propelling my hand so fast. -_-

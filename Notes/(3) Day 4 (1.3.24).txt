Day 4 Notes:
Never got to continue the other day. I have a lot of catching up to do... -_-
Started at 14:30.
-14:45: Modified three cards on the Trello board to now have checklists.
	>Those cards are:
		>>"Create PlantHandler object"
		>>"Create PlanterHandler object"
		>>"Create PlanterPathCreator object"
		>>I'm sure this won't get confusing...
-15:15: Completed Trello card "Create PlantHandler object"
	>Decided to make the methods return true or false where false is returned if an error occurred.
	>I cannot code for the life of me; seriously.
-15:19: Pushed to the git but it pushed twice? With the same commit message for both pushes? Whaaaaaaa-?
-15:38: Completed Trello card "Create PlanterHandler object"
	>Changed the name of the PlanterHandler class to PlanterManager to better distinguish it from the PlantHandler class.
-15:52: Completed Trello card "Create PlanterPathHandler object"
	>Removed the checklist item that stated to have the handler create all the paths at the start. I will add this later as its own card.
	>I think it would be a good idea to have the paths be created by using a text file to describe the layout. (Java is verbose when using text files though...)

Day 4 Notes:
Never got to continue the other day. I have a lot of catching up to do... -_-
Started at 14:30.
-14:45: Modified three cards on the Trello board to now have checklists.
	>Those cards are:
		>>"Create PlantHandler object"
		>>"Create PlanterHandler object"
		>>"Create PlanterPathCreator object"
		>>I'm sure this won't get confusing...
-15:15: Completed Trello card "Create PlantHandler object"
	>Decided to make the methods return true or false where false is returned if an error occurred.
	>I cannot code for the life of me; seriously.
-15:19: Pushed to the git but it pushed twice? With the same commit message for both pushes? Whaaaaaaa-?
-15:38: Completed Trello card "Create PlanterHandler object"
	>Changed the name of the PlanterHandler class to PlanterManager to better distinguish it from the PlantHandler class.
-15:52: Completed Trello card "Create PlanterPathHandler object"
	>Removed the checklist item that stated to have the handler create all the paths at the start. I will add this later as its own card.
	>I think it would be a good idea to have the paths be created by using a text file to describe the layout. (Java is verbose when using text files though...)
-15:56: Going to now review the Trello board and add new cards.
	>This should have been a daily task you moron!
-16:04: Board reviewed
	>Added new cards
	>To start, I will be coming up with a simple system to create PlanterPaths from text files. 
	>Then I will actually implement this system into the code with a text file.
	>Then I will have planters be created along these paths.
	>Then I will implement movement onto said planters.
	>And finally, I will have the planters ne able to plant new plants.
	>After this, I will check all the todo comments I've left in the code and review the Trello board again.
	>This is a lot to do, wow.
-16:36: Came up with a way to describe a "path set" in one line with each new line being a new "path set".
	>Hopefully this will work, but... The first solution that you come up with that seems simple is usually terrible and will not work. I didn't say that, CGP Grey did. Or something like that at least.
-16:55: Finished setting up the checklists for the new Trello cards. Breaktime!
